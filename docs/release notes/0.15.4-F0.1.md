Following are the changes in this release
* Bugfixes from Smartmaas
- Correction of the URI for requesting IDP for roles
- Adding "ifelse" condition for permiting the call by IDP

* Multiple IDP
- Enables to allow for validation of JWTs created and signed by external IDPs
- External in the sense that these IDPs are not part of the hosting environment of API-Umbrella
- External IDPs can be added together with their JWT signing secret via dedicated API endpoint and must be linked to an organization within the Keyrock IDP of API-Umbrella
- JWTs added as header in requests to API-Umbrella get validated against the secret for the particular IDP
- JWTs of external IDPs can then contain user roles for authorization and must match an equal role assigned to the organization within the Keyrock IDP of API-Umbrella

* i4Trust
- Integration of an attribute-based and iSHARE-compliant policy based authorization mode for NGSI-LD requests
- API-Umbrella evaluates incoming NGSI-LD requests and determines automatically the necessary policies
- Supported requests: HTTP GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE; upsert batch operations not supported for the moment
- Policies are checked against local and external authorisation registries according to the iSHARE scheme depending on the delegation of the policies
- Access for the request is granted if the requester's policies match the required policies for the NGSI-LD request under consideration of the delegation chain of requester's policies so that the final policy must have been issued by the organization hosting the environment for API-Umbrella
- The requesters JWT can either contain information about the external authorisation registry so that API-Umbrella will request the requester's policies from there, or the requester's policies are already encoded within the JWT
- JWTs must be signed using JWS standard with RS256 and must contain the complete certification chain in the x5c header (also see: https://dev.ishareworks.org/introduction/jwt.html)
- API-Umbrella validates JWTs based on the certificate chain and known root CA
- Data exchange with authorisation registries is performed based on the iSHARE scheme
